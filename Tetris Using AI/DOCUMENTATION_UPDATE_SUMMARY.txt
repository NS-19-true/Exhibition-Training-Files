## 🎯 Key Changes Made to All Files

### Consistent Messaging Across All 7 Files:

1. **Permission Modal Requirement**
   - Every file now emphasizes explicit permission requirement
   - User must click "START GAME & ENABLE CAMERA" before camera access
   - Browser permission dialog mentioned in all quick starts

2. **Index Finger Only Control**

   - Landmark 8 specifically mentioned in technical docs
   - Other fingers explicitly noted as ignored

3. **No Vertical Hand Control**
   - All files clarify hand Y-position is NOT used
   - Blocks fall at constant rate (not hand-controlled)
   - Only X-axis (left/right) position matters

4. **Constant Falling Speed**

   - Initial 1200ms drop interval documented
   - Speed independent of hand mentioned everywhere
   - Decreases 30ms per level explained

5. **Removed Features Clearly Stated**
   - All technical docs mention removed features:
     - No finger counting
